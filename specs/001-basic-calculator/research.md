# Research for Basic Calculator Feature

**Date**: 2025-11-23

## Outcome

No specific research tasks were identified as critical for this basic calculator library. All `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers from the specification phase were resolved. The chosen approaches (standard Python `float` precision, standard Python execution speed) are well-understood and do not require further research for this initial iteration.
