# ADR-0003: Code Organization and Project Structure

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-11-23
- **Feature:** 001-basic-calculator
- **Context:** A clear and maintainable project structure is required for the Basic Calculator library to facilitate development, testing, and future expansion.

## Decision

A single project structure will be adopted, with source code under `src/calculator/` (for core logic like `operations.py`) and unit tests under `tests/unit/` (e.g., `test_operations.py`).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provides a simple, intuitive, and scalable structure for a library of this scope.
- Separates concerns effectively (source vs. tests).
- Aligns with common Python project layouts.

### Negative

- May require refactoring into a more complex structure (e.g., `src/` as a package with multiple submodules) if the library grows significantly to include many more features (currently out of scope).

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1**: Flatter structure (e.g., all Python files directly in `src/`). Rejected as it doesn't clearly delineate sub-modules for the calculator's logic and is less organized for a growing project.
- **Alternative 2**: More complex hierarchy (e.g., multiple packages at root level). Rejected as overkill for a basic library and violates the KISS principle.
