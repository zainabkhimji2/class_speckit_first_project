# ADR-0001: Core Technology Stack for Basic Calculator Library

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-11-23
- **Feature:** 001-basic-calculator
- **Context:** The Basic Calculator library needs a foundational technology stack for its implementation, testing, and type checking, aligning with project constitution and user requirements.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

## Decision

The core technology stack for the Basic Calculator library will include:
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Testing Framework**: `pytest`
- **Type Checker**: `mypy`
- **Floating-Point Precision**: Standard Python `float`

## Consequences

### Positive

- Aligns with project constitution and leverages modern Python features.
- Ensures strong type checking and robust testing practices.
- Provides a simple and efficient solution suitable for a basic library.

### Negative

- Standard `float` precision may lead to inaccuracies for highly complex financial or scientific calculations, though this is considered out of scope for this basic version.
- Requires developers to be proficient in Python 3.12+, `pytest`, and `mypy`.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1 (Testing Framework)**: `unittest`. Rejected because `pytest` offers a more flexible and less verbose testing experience, aligning with the "Keep code clean and easy to read" principle from the project constitution.
- **Alternative 2 (Floating-Point Precision)**: Use Python `Decimal` type. Rejected for this basic iteration due to its added complexity and potential performance impact, as standard `float` is deemed sufficient and simpler for a basic calculator.
