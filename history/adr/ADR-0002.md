# ADR-0002: Architectural Style for Basic Calculator Library

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-11-23
- **Feature:** 001-basic-calculator
- **Context:** The Basic Calculator library needs a clear architectural style to guide its design and implementation, balancing simplicity with maintainability and testability for a basic arithmetic library.

## Decision

A simple, functional approach will be adopted for the core calculation logic. The library will be designed as a stateless component.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Promotes clear, concise, and testable code.
- Reduces complexity and makes the library easy to understand and use.
- Fits the "basic calculator" scope well.

### Negative

- May not be suitable for more complex calculators requiring state management or object-oriented hierarchies (though these are out of scope for this iteration).

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. Rejected for this basic iteration as a full OOP hierarchy would introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead for simple arithmetic functions. A functional approach better aligns with the "Keep it Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle.
