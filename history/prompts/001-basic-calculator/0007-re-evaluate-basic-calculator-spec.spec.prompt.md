## Prompt

"I've updated my specification based on your feedback.Please analyze it again for remaining gaps.Should I proceed to planning, or are there more clarifications needed?"

## Response snapshot

The specification for the Basic Calculator is now sufficiently clear for proceeding to the planning phase. Remaining missing areas are less critical for an initial basic library and can be addressed during planning or future iterations. Recommended next step: proceed to planning using `/sp.plan`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Re-confirmed that the Basic Calculator specification is sufficiently clear for planning.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No changes to spec file in this turn.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User is advised to proceed to the planning phase.
- 🧠 Reflection: User asked for re-evaluation of the spec after previous clarifications. Reaffirmed the previous assessment that the spec is ready for planning, considering the scope of a basic feature.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: null
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
